# Sluice

This is a WIP filter plugin that I'm making as an exercise to learn a bit about DSP and  audio APIs.

# todo:
- [x] Get windows ladspa to run in audacity
- [x] Implement test plugin - hard limiter
- [x] Research and implement simple DSP filter (biquad)
- [x] Find a better sweepable filter...? (switched to moog filter, needs some more analysis)
- [x] Factor cross-platform
- [ ] Compile on linux
- [ ] Add frameworks (lv2, vst, au?)
- [ ] ???
